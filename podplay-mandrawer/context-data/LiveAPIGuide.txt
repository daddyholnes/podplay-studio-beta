Key Points
Research suggests that integrating multimodal live APIs into your Streamlit app (app.py) is feasible for models like Gemini, Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, with streaming support for real-time interactions.
It seems likely that setup involves installing specific libraries (e.g., google-genai, openai, anthropic) and configuring API keys for each model.
The evidence leans toward handling multimodal inputs (text, images, audio) through streaming functions, with real-time updates displayed using Streamlit’s st.empty().
Direct Answer
Overview
This guide helps you integrate multimodal live APIs into your Streamlit application (app.py), enabling real-time interactions with models like Gemini, Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. These APIs support text, images, and audio, with streaming for dynamic updates.

Setup and Installation
First, install the necessary libraries:

For Gemini and Vertex AI: pip install google-genai
For OpenAI: pip install openai
For Anthropic: pip install anthropic
For Perplexity: Use openai as it’s compatible.
Next, get API keys from each provider’s platform (e.g., Google AI Studio for Gemini, OpenAI platform for OpenAI) and store them securely, such as in environment variables.

Implementation
Modify your app.py to handle streaming responses:

Create streaming functions for each model (e.g., get_gemini_stream_response, get_openai_stream_response) that process multimodal inputs.
Use st.empty() in your chat logic to display real-time updates as chunks of the response stream in.
For example, Gemini uses generate_content_stream for streaming, while OpenAI uses ChatCompletion.create(stream=True). Ensure your app handles images and audio by encoding them as base64 and including them in the request.

Unexpected Detail
While most models support text and image streaming, full voice and video interactions (e.g., Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime) may require WebSockets, which can be complex in Streamlit and might need additional JavaScript components.

Survey Note: Comprehensive Integration of Multimodal Live APIs into Streamlit App
This survey note provides a detailed exploration of integrating multimodal live APIs into your Streamlit application (app.py), covering setup, implementation, and advanced features for models like Gemini, Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. The focus is on enabling real-time interactions with multimodal inputs (text, images, audio) while leveraging Streamlit’s capabilities for dynamic updates.

Background and Context
Multimodal live APIs allow for real-time interactions with large language models (LLMs) across multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio. This is particularly useful for chat applications like your Streamlit app, which already supports various models through functions like get_gemini_response, get_openai_response, etc. The integration aims to enhance user experience by providing streaming responses, ensuring low latency and real-time feedback.

Given the current time (10:16 PM PDT on Wednesday, April 9, 2025), the latest APIs and SDKs are considered, with a focus on their streaming capabilities for multimodal inputs. The provided app.py file, which uses Streamlit for a chat interface, serves as the base for these integrations.

Setup and Installation
To begin, you need to install the required libraries and configure API keys for each model. Below is a detailed breakdown:

Library Installation:
For Gemini and Vertex AI, install the google-genai library:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install google-genai
This library provides access to the Gen AI SDK, which supports both standard and live APIs for Gemini models.
For OpenAI, install the openai library:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install openai
This is used for the Realtime API and standard chat completions with streaming.
For Anthropic, install the anthropic library:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install anthropic
This supports streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Claude models.
For Perplexity, since it’s OpenAI-compatible, use the openai library, ensuring compatibility with Perplexity’s API.
API Key Configuration:
Gemini: Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio (Gemini API Documentation). Store it securely, e.g., as an environment variable.
OpenAI: Get an API key from the OpenAI platform (OpenAI Realtime API Documentation). Store it securely.
Anthropic: Obtain an API key from the Anthropic console (Anthropic API Documentation). Store it securely.
Perplexity: Get an API key from Perplexity account settings (Perplexity API Documentation). Store it securely.
Ensure these keys are accessible in your Streamlit app, possibly through environment variables or session state.

Implementation Details
To integrate multimodal live APIs, modify your app.py to handle streaming responses. This involves creating new functions for each model to process multimodal inputs and display real-time updates using Streamlit’s st.empty().

Streaming Response Functions
Below are detailed implementations for each model, ensuring compatibility with multimodal inputs (text, images, audio) and streaming:

Gemini (Standard Streaming):
Gemini supports streaming through generate_content_stream in the Gen AI SDK. Here’s the implementation:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def get_gemini_stream_response(user_input):
    from google import genai
    from google.genai.types import types
    client = genai.Client()
    
    # Build contents (multimodal inputs)
    contents = [user_input]
    
    # Add image if available (base64 encoded)
    if st.session_state.uploaded_image:
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(st.session_state.uploaded_image)
        contents.append(types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_bytes, mime_type='image/jpeg'))
    
    # Add audio if available (base64 encoded)
    if hasattr(st.session_state, 'audio_data') and st.session_state.audio_data:
        audio_bytes = base64.b64decode(st.session_state.audio_data)
        contents.append(types.Part.from_bytes(data=audio_bytes, mime_type='audio/wav'))
    
    # Generate stream
    stream = client.models.generate_content_stream(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",  # Use appropriate model name
        contents=contents,
        generation_config=types.GenerationConfig(temperature=st.session_state.temperature),
    )
    
    # Return text chunks from the stream
    return (candidate.content.parts[0].text if candidate.content.parts else "" for candidate in stream)
This function handles text, images, and audio, returning a generator over text chunks.

OpenAI (Standard Streaming):
OpenAI supports streaming through ChatCompletion.create(stream=True). For multimodal inputs like images (e.g., GPT-4o), include them in the message content:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def get_openai_stream_response(user_input):
    import openai
    
    # Build messages (multimodal inputs)
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": []}]
    
    # Add text input
    messages[0]["content"].append({"type": "text", "text": user_input})
    
    # Add image if available (base64 encoded)
    if st.session_state.uploaded_image:
        image_base64 = st.session_state.uploaded_image  # Already base64 encoded
        messages[0]["content"].append({"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_base64}"}})
    
    # Generate stream
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",  # Use appropriate model name
        messages=messages,
        stream=True,
        temperature=st.session_state.temperature,
    )
    
    # Return text chunks from the stream
    return (chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '') for chunk in response)
This handles text and images, returning a generator over text chunks.

Anthropic (SSE Streaming):
Anthropic supports streaming through messages.create(stream=True). For multimodal inputs like images (e.g., Claude Opus), include them as separate message parts:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def get_anthropic_stream_response(user_input):
    from anthropic import Anthropic
    
    client = Anthropic()
    
    # Build messages (multimodal inputs)
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
    ]
    
    # Add image if available (base64 encoded)
    if st.session_state.uploaded_image:
        image_base64 = st.session_state.uploaded_image  # Already base64 encoded
        messages.append({"type": "image", "data": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_base64}"}})
    
    # Generate stream
    response = client.messages.create(
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=messages,
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",  # Use appropriate model name
        temperature=st.session_state.temperature,
        stream=True,
    )
    
    # Return text chunks from the stream
    return (event.message.content if event.type == "message" else "" for event in response)
This handles text and images, returning a generator over text chunks.

Perplexity (OpenAI-Compatible Streaming):
Perplexity’s API is compatible with OpenAI’s format. Use OpenAI’s streaming method with Perplexity’s model name:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def get_perplexity_stream_response(user_input):
    import openai
    
    # Build messages (multimodal inputs)
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": []}]
    
    # Add text input
    messages[0]["content"].append({"type": "text", "text": user_input})
    
    # Add image if available (base64 encoded)
    if st.session_state.uploaded_image:
        image_base64 = st.session_state.uploaded_image  # Already base64 encoded
        messages[0]["content"].append({"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_base64}"}})
    
    # Generate stream
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="perplexity/sonar-pro",  # Use appropriate Perplexity model name
        messages=messages,
        stream=True,
        temperature=st.session_state.temperature,
    )
    
    # Return text chunks from the stream
    return (chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '') for chunk in response)
This handles text and images, returning a generator over text chunks.

Vertex AI (Using Gemini Models)
Vertex AI uses Gemini models under the hood and supports streaming through its API. Implement a similar streaming function using the Vertex AI client library:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
def get_vertex_ai_stream_response(user_input):
    from google.cloud import aiplatform
    
    client_options = {"api_endpoint": f"{REGION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com"}
    client = aiplatform.gapic.PredictionServiceClient(client_options=client_options)
    model_name = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{REGION}/publishers/google/models/gemini-2-pro"
    
    # Build content (multimodal inputs)
    content = [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": user_input}]}]
    
    # Add image if available (base64 encoded)
    if st.session_state.uploaded_image:
        image_base64 = st.session_state.uploaded_image
        content[0]["parts"].append({"inline_data": {"mime_type": "image/jpeg", "data": image_base64}})
    
    # Generate stream (hypothetical, based on Vertex AI docs)
    response = client.generate_content(model_name=model_name, content=content, stream=True)
    return (chunk.text if hasattr(chunk, 'text') else "" for chunk in response)
Note: Ensure you set up Google Cloud credentials and replace REGION and PROJECT_ID with your values.

Main Chat Logic Update
Update your main chat logic in app.py to handle streaming responses when a streaming-capable model is selected. Use st.empty() for real-time updates:

python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
# Inside your main chat logic (e.g., after user input is captured)
if st.session_state.current_model in ["Gemini", "Vertex AI", "OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Perplexity"]:
    stream_function = {
        "Gemini": get_gemini_stream_response,
        "Vertex AI": get_vertex_ai_stream_response,
        "OpenAI": get_openai_stream_response,
        "Anthropic": get_anthropic_stream_response,
        "Perplexity": get_perplexity_stream_response,
    }[st.session_state.current_model]
    
    stream = stream_function(user_input)
    
    placeholder = st.empty()
    
    full_response = ""
    
    # Iterate over chunks and update placeholder in real-time
    for chunk in stream:
        full_response += chunk.strip()  # Remove any extra whitespace or newlines
        placeholder.write(full_response)
else:
    # Handle standard non-streaming responses (if any)
    ai_response = get_standard_response(st.session_state.current_model, user_input)
    st.write(ai_response)
Ensure your model_options in the sidebar includes all streaming-capable models, e.g., add "Gemini", "OpenAI", etc., to the list.

Advanced Features and Considerations
To enhance your integration, consider the following advanced features:

Session Management: For models like Gemini Live or Vertex AI Live API, manage sessions using session IDs or tokens to maintain context across interactions.
Function Calling: Enable function calling for models like Gemini or Anthropic by defining tools or functions in your request, enhancing interactivity.
Context Window Management: Be mindful of token limits (e.g., Gemini’s 32,768 tokens) when sending long conversations or large multimodal inputs to avoid exceeding limits.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for network issues or API errors during streaming, e.g., using try-except blocks around API calls.
Real-Time Voice/Video: For full multimodal live APIs including voice and video (e.g., Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime), additional setup is required. This involves using WebSockets or specific SDK methods, which may require embedding JavaScript components in Streamlit or using libraries like websockets in Python. This is more complex and may need further research.
Performance and Limitations
Streamlit Limitations: Streamlit is designed for synchronous code execution. While st.empty() supports real-time updates, handling long-running WebSocket connections may require threading or custom components, which can be challenging.
Testing: Test your implementation thoroughly with different inputs (text-only, text+image, text+audio) to ensure real-time updates display correctly.
Performance: Streaming responses may increase latency due to network overhead. Optimize your app by minimizing unnecessary reruns and ensuring efficient handling of large inputs.
