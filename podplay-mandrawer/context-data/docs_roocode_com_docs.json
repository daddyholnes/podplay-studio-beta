      "This page answers some common questions about Roo Code.",
      "Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in your editor.",
      "Roo Code uses large language models (LLMs) to understand your requests and translate them into actions.  It can:",
      "You interact with Roo Code through a chat interface, where you provide instructions and review/approve its proposed actions.",
      "Roo Code can help with a variety of coding tasks, including:",
      "The Roo Code extension itself is free and open-source. However, Roo Code relies on external API providers (likeAnthropic,OpenAI,OpenRouter,Requesty, etc.) for its AI capabilities.  These providers typically charge for API usage based on the number of tokens processed.  You will need to create an account and obtain an API key from your chosen provider.  SeeSetting Up Your First AI Providerfor details.",
      "Roo Code is a powerful tool, and it's important to use it responsibly.  Here are some things to keep in mind:",
      "See theInstallation Guidefor detailed instructions.",
      "Roo Code supports a wide range of API providers, including:",
      "Each API provider has its own process for obtaining an API key.  See theSetting Up Your First AI Providerfor links to the relevant documentation for each provider.",
      "Yes, Roo Code supports running models locally usingOllamaandLM Studio.  SeeUsing Local Modelsfor instructions.",
      "Open the Roo Code panel () and type your task in the chat box. Be clear and specific about what you want Roo Code to do. SeeTyping Your Requestsfor best practices.",
      "Modesare different personas that Roo Code can adopt, each with a specific focus and set of capabilities. The built-in modes are:",
      "Use the dropdown menu in the chat input area to select a different mode, or use the/command to switch to a specific mode.",
      "Toolsare how Roo Code interacts with your system.  Roo Code automatically selects and uses the appropriate tools to complete your tasks. You don't need to call tools directly. You will be prompted to approve or reject each tool use.",
      "Context mentionsare a way to provide Roo Code with specific information about your project, such as files, folders, or problems. Use the \"@\" symbol followed by the item you want to mention (e.g.,@/src/file.ts,@problems).",
      "Yes, if you are using a provider with a model that support web browsing. Be mindful of the security implications of allowing this.",
      "Yes, Roo Code can execute commands in your VS Code terminal.  You will be prompted to approve each command before it's executed, unless you've enabled auto-approval for commands. Be extremely cautious about auto-approving commands. If you're experiencing issues with terminal commands, see theShell Integration Guidefor troubleshooting.",
      "You can provide feedback by approving or rejecting Roo Code's proposed actions. You can provide additional feedback by using the feedback field.",
      "Yes, you can customize Roo Code in several ways:",
      "Yes, Roo Code has a few settings that when enabled will automatically approve actions. Find out morehere.",
      "Yes, if you use alocal model.",
      "MCPis a protocol that allows Roo Code to communicate with external servers, extending its capabilities with custom tools and resources.",
      "Yes, you can create your own MCP servers to add custom functionality to Roo Code. See theMCP documentationfor details.",
      "The error message should provide some information about the problem. If you're unsure how to resolve it, seek help in the community forums.",
      "Roo Code uses VS Code's built-in file editing capabilities.  You can use the standard \"Undo\" command (Ctrl/Cmd + Z) to revert changes. Also, if experimental checkpoints are enabled, Roo can revert changes made to a file.",

For each subtask, create a new task with a clear, specific instruction using the new_task tool:\\n   - Choose the most appropriate mode for each task based on its nature and requirements\\n   - Provide detailed requirements and summaries of completed work for context\\n   - Store all subtask-related content in a dedicated prompt directory\\n   - Ensure subtasks focus on their specific stage while maintaining compatibility with other modules\\n\\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks:\\n   - Arrange subtasks in a logical sequence based on dependencies\\n   - Establish checkpoints to validate incremental achievements\\n   - Reserve adequate context space for complex subtasks\\n   - Define clear completion criteria for each subtask\\n   - When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps\\n\\n4. Facilitate effective communication throughout the workflow:\\n   - Use clear, natural language for subtask descriptions (avoid code blocks in descriptions)\\n   - Provide sufficient context information when initiating each subtask\\n   - Keep instructions concise and unambiguous\\n   - Clearly label inputs and expected outputs for each subtask\\n\\n5. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow:\\n   - Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes\\n   - Document the workflow architecture and dependencies between subtasks\\n   - Visualize the workflow when helpful for understanding\\n\\n6. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\\n\\n7. You can also manage custom modes by editing custom_modes.json and .roomodes files directly. This allows you to create, modify, or delete custom modes as part of your orchestration capabilities.\\n\\n8. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\\n\\n9. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.\",\"groups\":[\"read\",[\"edit\",{\"fileRegex\":\"\\\\.roomodes$|cline_custom_modes\\\\.json$\",\"description\":\"Mode configuration files only\"}]],\"source\":\"global\"}\n```"

      "Roo Code will guide you through the process. However, for fine-tuning modes or making specific adjustments, you'll want to use the Prompts tab or manual configuration methods described below.",
      "When enabled, Roo allows you to create custom modes using prompts like 'Make me a custom mode that...'. Disabling this reduces your system prompt by about 700 tokens when this feature isn't needed. When disabled you can still manually create custom modes using the + button above or by editing the related config JSON.",

      "Custom instructions:Added near the end of the system prompt, these provide specific guidelines that modify or refine Roo's behavior for the mode. You can define these using thecustomInstructionsJSON property, and/or by adding instruction files to a dedicated directory (see below). The preferred method for file-based instructions is now using a.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/directory, which allows for better organization and takes precedence over the older.roorules-{mode-slug}file method. This structured placement allows for more nuanced control over Roo's responses.",

      "Custom Instructions allow you to personalize how Roo behaves, providing specific guidance that shapes responses, coding style, and decision-making processes.",
      "You can provide custom instructions using dedicated files or directories within your workspace. This allows for better organization and version control.",
      "Workspace-Wide Instructions:Apply to all modes in the project.",
      "Mode-Specific Instructions:Apply only to a specific mode (e.g.,code).",
      "The directory methods take precedence if they exist and contain files. SeeWorkspace-Level InstructionsandMode-Specific Instructionsfor details.",
      "Custom Instructions define specific behaviors, preferences, and constraints beyond Roo's basic role definition. Examples include coding style, documentation standards, testing requirements, and workflow guidelines.",
      "These instructions apply across all workspaces and maintain your preferences regardless of which project you're working on.",
      "How to set them:",
      "These instructions only apply within your current workspace, allowing you to customize Roo Code's behavior for specific projects.",
      "Workspace-wide instructions apply to all modes within the current project and can be defined using files:",
      "Mode-specific instructions can be set in two independent ways that can be used simultaneously:",
      "Using the Prompts Tab:",
      "Open Tab:Click theicon in the Roo Code top menu bar",
      "Select Mode:Under the Modes heading, click the button for the mode you want to customize",
      "Enter Instructions:Enter your instructions in the text area under \"Mode-specific Custom Instructions (optional)\"",
      "Save Changes:Click \"Done\" to save your changes",
      "If the mode itself is global (not workspace-specific), any custom instructions you set for it will also apply globally for that mode across all workspaces.",
      "Using Rule Files/Directories:Provide mode-specific instructions via files:",
      "Instructions from the Prompts tab, the mode-specific directory/file, and the workspace-wide directory/file are all combined. See the section below for the exact order.",
      "Instructions are placed in the system prompt in this exact format:",
      "Note: The exact order ensures that more specific instructions (mode-level) appear before more general ones (workspace-wide), and directory-based rules take precedence over file-based fallbacks within each level.",
      "When working in team environments, using the.roo/rules/directory structure (and potentially.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/directories for specific modes) under version control is the recommended way to standardize Roo's behavior across your team. This allows for better organization of multiple instruction files and ensures consistent code style, documentation practices, and development workflows. The older.roorulesfile method can still be used but offers less flexibility.",
      "For advanced customization, combine withCustom Modesto create specialized environments with specific tool access, file restrictions, and tailored instructions."

      "Roo Code provides sophisticated browser automation capabilities that let you interact with websites directly from VS Code. This feature enables testing web applications, automating browser tasks, and capturing screenshots without leaving your development environment.",

      "By default, Roo Code uses a built-in browser that:",
      "All of this happens directly within VS Code, with no setup required.",
      "A typical browser interaction follows this pattern:",
      "For example:",
      "The browser_action tool controls a browser instance that returns screenshots and console logs after each action, allowing you to see the results of interactions.",
      "Key characteristics:",
      "To change Browser / Computer Use settings in Roo:",
      "Open Settings by clicking the gear icon‚Üí Browser / Computer Use",
      "Purpose: Master toggle that enables Roo to interact with websites using a Puppeteer-controlled browser.",
      "To change this setting:",
      "Check or uncheck the \"Enable browser tool\" checkbox within your Browser / Computer Use settings",
      "Purpose: Determines the resolution of the browser session Roo Code uses.",
      "Tradeoff: Higher values provide a larger viewport but increase token usage.",
      "To change this setting:",
      "Click the dropdown menu under \"Viewport size\" within your Browser / Computer Use settings",
      "Select one of the available options:",
      "Select your desired resolution.",
      "Purpose: Controls the WebP compression quality of browser screenshots.",

      "To change this setting:",
      "Adjust the slider under \"Screenshot quality\" within your Browser / Computer Use settings",
      "Set a value between 1-100% (default is 75%)",
      "Higher values provide clearer screenshots but increase token usage:",
      "Purpose: Connect Roo to an existing Chrome browser instead of using the built-in browser.",
      "Benefits:",
      "Requirements: Chrome must be running with remote debugging enabled.",
      "To enable this feature:",
      "Check the \"Use remote browser connection\" box in Browser / Computer Use settings",

      "Restore Files Only- Reverts only workspace files to checkpoint state without modifying conversation history. Ideal for comparing alternative implementations while maintaining chat context, allowing you to seamlessly switch between different project states. This option does not require confirmation and lets you quickly switch between different implementations.",
      "Restore Files & Task- Reverts both workspace files AND removes all subsequent conversation messages. Use when you want to completely reset both your code and conversation back to the checkpoint's point in time. This option requires confirmation in a dialog as it cannot be undone.",

      "When restoration executes, Roo Code:",
      "Checkpoints are task-scoped, meaning they are specific to a single task.",
      "Checkpoint comparison uses Git's underlying diff capabilities to produce structured file differences:",
      "The checkpoint system uses intelligent file exclusion to track only relevant files:",
      "The system has comprehensive built-in exclusion patterns that automatically ignore:",
      "These patterns are written to the shadow repository's.git/info/excludefile during initialization.",
      "The checkpoint system respects.gitignorepatterns in your workspace:",
      "The.rooignorefile (which controls AI access to files) is separate from checkpoint tracking:",
      "This separation is intentional, as.rooignorelimits which files the AI can access, not which files should be tracked for version history.",
      "The checkpoint system includes special handling for nested Git repositories:",
      "Operations are queued to prevent concurrent Git operations that might corrupt repository state. This ensures that rapid checkpoint operations complete safely even when requested in quick succession.",

      "Temperature controls the randomness of AI model outputs. Adjusting this setting optimizes results for different tasks - from precise code generation to creative brainstorming. Temperature is one of the most powerful parameters for controlling AI behavior. A well-tuned temperature setting can dramatically improve the quality and appropriateness of responses for specific tasks.",
      "Temperature is a setting (usually between 0.0 and 2.0) that controls how random or predictable the AI's output is. Finding the right balance is key: lower values make the output more focused and consistent, while higher values encourage more creativity and variation. For many coding tasks, a moderate temperature (around 0.3 to 0.7) often works well, but the best setting depends on what you're trying to achieve.",
      "Temperature controls output randomness, not code quality or accuracy directly. Key points:",
      "Roo Code uses a default temperature of 0.0 for most models, optimizing for maximum determinism and precision in code generation. This applies to OpenAI models, Anthropic models (non-thinking variants), LM Studio models, and most other providers.",
      "Some models use higher default temperatures - DeepSeek R1 models and certain reasoning-focused models default to 0.6, providing a balance between determinism and creative exploration.",
      "Models with thinking capabilities (where the AI shows its reasoning process) require a fixed temperature of 1.0 which cannot be changed, as this setting ensures optimal performance of the thinking mechanism. This applies to any model with the \":thinking\" flag enabled.",
      "Some specialized models don't support temperature adjustments at all, in which case Roo Code respects these limitations automatically.",
      "Here are some examples of temperature settings that might work well for different tasks:",
      "These are starting points ‚Äì it's important toexperiment with different settingsto find what works best for your specific needs and preferences.",

      "Experimenting with different temperature settings is the most effective way to discover what works best for your specific needs:",
      "Remember that different models may respond differently to the same temperature values, and thinking-enabled models always use a fixed temperature of 1.0 regardless of your settings."
