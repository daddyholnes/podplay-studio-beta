      "Cline is an AI development assistant which integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It provides an interface between your IDE and LLMs facilitating code development, increasing productivity and lowering the barrier to entry for new coders. Depending on permissions, Cline can read/write files, execute commands, use your web browser, and expand its capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers.",
      "What makes Cline distinctive is its thoughtful approach to code generation and its extensive integration capabilities. Rather than simply generating code snippets, Cline collaborates with developers by planning solutions step-by-step, maintaining awareness of the entire development environment, and requiring explicit approval for all changes. It can understand large codebases, accelerate onboarding for new engineers, and connect with hundreds of tools through its Model Context Protocol Marketplace, enabling everything from streamlined project deployments to automated incident response—all through natural language commands.",

      "DeepSeek: 64,000 tokens",
      "When the whiteboard is full, you need to erase (clear context) to write more",
      "⚠️Important: Having a large context window (like Claude's 200k tokens) doesn't mean you should fill it completely. Just like a cluttered whiteboard, too much information can make it harder to focus on what's important.",

      "Think of a context window as your AI assistant's working memory - similar to RAM in a computer. It determines how much information the model can \"remember\" and process at once during your conversation. This includes:",
      "Your code files and conversations",
      "The assistant's responses",
      "Any documentation or additional context provided",
      "Context windows are measured in tokens (roughly 3/4 of a word in English). Different models have different context window sizes:",
      "Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 200K tokens",
      "DeepSeek Models: 128K tokens",
      "Gemini Flash 2.0: 1M tokens",
      "Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2M tokens",
      "When you reach the limit of your context window, older information needs to be removed to make room for new information - just like clearing RAM to run new programs. This is why sometimes AI assistants might seem to \"forget\" earlier parts of your conversation.",
      "Cline helps you manage this limitation with its Context Window Progress Bar, which shows:",
      "Input tokens (what you've sent to the model)",
      "Output tokens (what the model has generated)",
      "A visual representation of how much of your context window you've used",
      "The total capacity for your chosen model",

      "Last updated2 months ago",
      "While running models locally might seem appealing for cost savings, we currently don't recommend any local models for use with Cline.at using Cline's essential tools and typically retain only 1-26% of the original model's capabilities. The full cloud version of DeepSeek-R1, for example, is 671B parameters - local versions are drastically simplified copies that struggle with complex tasks and tool usage. Even with high-end hardware (RTX 3070+, 32GB+ RAM), you'll experience slower responses, less reliable tool execution, and reduced capabilities. For the best development experience, we recommend sticking with the cloud models listed above."

      "Welcome to the Cline Prompting Guide! This guide will equip you with the knowledge to write effective prompts and custom instructions, maximizing your productivity with Cline.",
      "Think ofcustom instructions as Cline's programming. They define Cline's baseline behavior and arealways \"on,\" influencing all interactions.Instructions can be broad and abstract, or specific and explicit. You might want Cline to have a unique personality, or produce output in a particular file format, or adhere to certain architectural principles. Custom instructions can standardize Cline's output in ways you define, which is especially valuable when working with others. See thefor using Custom Instructions in a team context.NOTE: Modifying the Custom Instructions field updates Cline's prompt cache, discarding accumulated context. This causes a temporary increase in cost while that context is replaced. Update Custom Instructions between conversations whenever possible.",
      "To add custom instructions:",
      "Open VSCode",
      "Click the Cline extension settings dial ⚙️",
      "Find the \"Custom Instructions\" field",
      "Paste your instructions",
      "Custom instructions are powerful for:",
      "Enforcing Coding Style and Best Practices: Ensure Cline always adheres to your team's coding conventions, naming conventions, and best practices.",
      "Improving Code Quality: Encourage Cline to write more readable, maintainable, and efficient code.",
      "Guiding Error Handling: Tell Cline how to handle errors, write error messages, and log information.",
      "NOTE: Modifying the.clinerulesfile updates Cline's prompt cache, discarding accumulated context. This causes a temporary increase in cost while that context is replaced. Update the.clinerulesfile between conversations whenever possible.",
      "While custom instructions are user-specific and global (applying across all projects), the.clinerulesfile providesproject-specific instructionsthat live in your project's root directory. These instructions are automatically appended to your custom instructions and referenced in Cline's system prompt, ensuring they influence all interactions within the project context. This makes it an excellent tool for:",
      "The.clinerulesfile is excellent for:",
      "Maintaining project standards across team members",
      "Enforcing development practices",
      "Managing documentation requirements",
      "Setting up analysis frameworks",
      "Defining project-specific behaviors",
      "Version Controlled: The.clinerulesfile becomes part of your project's source code",
      "Team Consistency: Ensures consistent behavior across all team members",
      "Project-Specific: Rules and standards tailored to each project's needs",
      "Institutional Knowledge: Maintains project standards and practices in code",
      "Place the.clinerulesfile in your project's root directory:",
      "Be Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.",
      "Focus on Desired Outcomes: Describe the results you want, not the specific steps.",
      "Test and Iterate: Experiment to find what works best for your workflow.",
      "While a single.clinerulesfile works well for simpler projects, Cline now supports a.clinerulesfolder for more sophisticated rule organization. This modular approach brings several advantages:",
      "Instead of a single file, create a.clinerules/directory in your project root:",
      "Cline automatically processesall Markdown filesinside the.clinerules/directory, combining them into a unified set of rules. The numeric prefixes (optional) help organize files in a logical sequence.",
      "For projects with multiple contexts or teams, maintain a rules bank directory:",
      "Contextual Activation: Copy only relevant rules from the bank to the active folder",
      "Easier Maintenance: Update individual rule files without affecting others",
      "Team Flexibility: Different team members can activate rules specific to their current task",
      "Reduced Noise: Keep the active ruleset focused and relevant",
      "Switch between client projects:",
      "Adapt to different tech stacks:",
      "Keep individual rule files focused on specific concerns",
      "Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the rule's purpose",
      "Consider git-ignoring the active.clinerules/folder while tracking theclinerules-bank/",
      "Create team scripts to quickly activate common rule combinations",
      "The folder system transforms your Cline rules from a static document into a dynamic knowledge system that adapts to your team's changing contexts and requirements.",
      "The.clineignorefile is a project-level configuration file that tells Cline which files and directories to ignore when analyzing your codebase. Similar to.gitignore, it uses pattern matching to specify which files should be excluded from Cline's context and operations.",
      "Reduce Noise: Exclude auto-generated files, build artifacts, and other non-essential content",
      "Improve Performance: Limit the amount of code Cline needs to process",
      "Focus Attention: Direct Cline to relevant parts of your codebase",
      "Protect Sensitive Data: Prevent Cline from accessing sensitive configuration files",
      "Prompting is how you communicate your needs for a given task in the back-and-forth chat with Cline.Cline understands natural language, so write conversationally.",
      "Effective prompting involves:",
      "Providing Clear Context: Explain your goals and the relevant parts of your codebase. Use@to reference files or folders.",
      "Breaking Down Complexity: Divide large tasks into smaller steps.",
      "Asking Specific Questions: Guide Cline toward the desired outcome.",
      "Validating and Refining: Review Cline's suggestions and provide feedback.",

      "Generating Code:\"Cline, create a component that displays user profiles. The list should be sortable and filterable. Generate the code for this component.\"",
      "Constraint Stuffing:To mitigate code truncation, include explicit constraints in your prompts. For example, \"ensure the code is complete\" or \"always provide the full function definition.\"",
      "Confidence Checks:Ask Cline to rate its confidence (e.g., \"on a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this solution?\")",
      "Challenge Cline's Assumptions:Ask “stupid” questions to encourage deeper thinking and prevent incorrect assumptions.",

      "Paste into Cline- Add as custom instructions or in a .clinerules file",
      "Initialize- Ask Cline to \"initialize memory bank\"",
      "The Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that allows Cline to maintain context across sessions. It transforms Cline from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that can effectively \"remember\" your project details over time.",
      "Context Preservation: Maintain project knowledge across sessions",
      "Consistent Development: Experience predictable interactions with Cline",
      "Self-Documenting Projects: Create valuable project documentation as a side effect",
      "Scalable to Any Project: Works with projects of any size or complexity",
      "Technology Agnostic: Functions with any tech stack or language",
      "The Memory Bank isn't a Cline-specific feature - it's a methodology for managing AI context through structured documentation. When you instruct Cline to \"follow custom instructions,\" it reads the Memory Bank files to rebuild its understanding of your project.",
      "Memory Bank files are simply markdown files you create in your project. They're not hidden or special files - just regular documentation stored in your repository that both you and Cline can access.",
      "Files are organized in a hierarchical structure that builds up a complete picture of your project:",
      "projectbrief.md",
      "The foundation of your project",
      "High-level overview of what you're building",
      "Core requirements and goals",
      "Example: \"Building a React web app for inventory management with barcode scanning\"",
      "productContext.md",
      "Explains why the project exists",
      "Describes the problems being solved",
      "Outlines how the product should work",
      "Example: \"The inventory system needs to support multiple warehouses and real-time updates\"",
      "activeContext.md",
      "The most frequently updated file",
      "Contains current work focus and recent changes",

      "You discover new patterns in your project",
      "After implementing significant changes",
      "When you explicitly request with\"update memory bank\"",
      "When you feel context needs clarification",
      "The Memory Bank files are regular markdown files stored in your project repository, typically in amemory-bank/folder. They're not hidden system files - they're designed to be part of your project documentation.",

      "Custom Instructions: Applied globally to all Cline conversations. Good for consistent behavior across all projects.",
      ".clinerules file: Project-specific and stored in your repository. Good for per-project customization.",
      "Both methods achieve the same goal - the choice depends on whether you want global or local application of the Memory Bank system.",
      "As you work with Cline, your context window will eventually fill up (note the progress bar). When you notice Cline's responses slowing down or references to earlier parts of the conversation becoming less accurate, it's time to:",
      "Ask Cline to\"update memory bank\"to document the current state",
      "Start a new conversation/task",
      "Ask Cline to\"follow your custom instructions\"in the new conversation",
      "This workflow ensures that important context is preserved in your Memory Bank files before the context window is cleared, allowing you to continue seamlessly in a fresh conversation.",
      "Update the Memory Bank after significant milestones or changes in direction. For active development, updates every few sessions can be helpful. Use the\"update memory bank\"command when you want to ensure all context is preserved. However, you will notice Cline automatically updating the Memory Bank as well.",
      "Yes! The Memory Bank concept is a documentation methodology that can work with any AI assistant that can read documentation files. The specific commands might differ, but the structured approach to maintaining context works across tools.",
      "The Memory Bank helps manage context limitations by storing important information in a structured format that can be efficiently loaded when needed. This prevents context bloat while ensuring critical information is available.",
      "Absolutely! The Memory Bank approach works for any project that benefits from structured documentation - from writing books to planning events. The file structure might vary, but the concept remains powerful.",
      "While similar in concept, the Memory Bank provides a more structured and comprehensive approach specifically designed to maintain context across AI sessions. It goes beyond what a single README typically covers.",
      "Start with a basic project brief and let the structure evolve",
      "Let Cline help create the initial structure",
      "Review and adjust files as needed to match your workflow",
      "Let patterns emerge naturally as you work",

This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.## Memory Bank StructureThe Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:flowchart TDPB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]PB --> TC[techContext.md]PC --> AC[activeContext.md]SP --> ACTC --> ACAC --> P[progress.md]### Core Files (Required)1. `projectbrief.md`- Foundation document that shapes all other files- Created at project start if it doesn't exist- Defines core requirements and goals- Source of truth for project scope2. `productContext.md`- Why this project exists- Problems it solves- How it should work- User experience goals3. `activeContext.md`- Current work focus- Recent changes- Next steps- Active decisions and considerations- Important patterns and preferences- Learnings and project insights4. `systemPatterns.md`- System architecture- Key technical decisions- Design patterns in use- Component relationships- Critical implementation paths5. `techContext.md`- Technologies used- Development setup- Technical constraints- Dependencies- Tool usage patterns6. `progress.md`- What works- What's left to build- Current status- Known issues- Evolution of project decisions### Additional ContextCreate additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:- Complex feature documentation- Integration specifications- API documentation- Testing strategies- Deployment procedures## Core Workflows### Plan Modeflowchart TDStart[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]### Act Modeflowchart TDStart[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]Context --> Update[Update Documentation]Update --> Execute[Execute Task]Execute --> Document[Document Changes]## Documentation UpdatesMemory Bank updates occur when:1.

      "```\n# Cline's Memory BankI am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.## Memory Bank StructureThe Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:flowchart TDPB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]PB --> TC[techContext.md]PC --> AC[activeContext.md]SP --> ACTC --> ACAC --> P[progress.md]### Core Files (Required)1. `projectbrief.md`- Foundation document that shapes all other files- Created at project start if it doesn't exist- Defines core requirements and goals- Source of truth for project scope2. `productContext.md`- Why this project exists- Problems it solves- How it should work- User experience goals3. `activeContext.md`- Current work focus- Recent changes- Next steps- Active decisions and considerations- Important patterns and preferences- Learnings and project insights4. `systemPatterns.md`- System architecture- Key technical decisions- Design patterns in use- Component relationships- Critical implementation paths5. `techContext.md`- Technologies used- Development setup- Technical constraints- Dependencies- Tool usage patterns6. `progress.md`- What works- What's left to build- Current status- Known issues- Evolution of project decisions### Additional ContextCreate additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:- Complex feature documentation- Integration specifications- API documentation- Testing strategies- Deployment procedures## Core Workflows### Plan Modeflowchart TDStart[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]### Act Modeflowchart TDStart[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]Context --> Update[Update Documentation]Update --> Execute[Execute Task]Execute --> Document[Document Changes]## Documentation UpdatesMemory Bank updates occur when:1. Discovering new project patterns2. After implementing significant changes3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)4.

Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.\n```"

      "When working with AI coding assistants, it's easy to lose control as they make rapid changes to your codebase. That's why we built Checkpoints - your safety net for experimenting confidently.",
      "Last updated28 days ago",
      "Checkpoints automatically save snapshots of your workspace after each step in a task. This powerful feature lets you:",
      "Track and review changes made during a task",
      "Roll back to any previous point if needed",
      "Experiment confidently with auto-approve mode",
      "Maintain full control over your workspace",
      "Cline creates a checkpoint after each tool use (file edits, commands, etc.). These checkpoints:",
      "Work alongside your Git workflow without interference",
      "Maintain context between restores",
      "Use a shadow Git repository to track changes",
      "For example, if you're working on a feature and Cline makes multiple file changes, each change creates a checkpoint. This means you can review each modification and, if needed, roll back to any point without affecting your main Git repository.",
      "After each tool use, you can:",
      "Click the \"Compare\" button to see modified files",
      "Click the \"Restore\" button to open restore options",
      "To restore to a previous point:",
      "Click the \"Restore\" button next to any step",
      "Choose from three options:",
      "Restore Task and Workspace: Reset both codebase and task to that point",
      "Restore Task Only: Keep codebase changes but revert task context",
      "Restore Workspace Only: Reset codebase while preserving task context",
      "Example: If Cline makes changes you don't like while styling a component, you can use \"Restore Workspace Only\" to revert the code changes while keeping the conversation context, allowing you to try a different approach.",
      "Checkpoints let you be more experimental with Cline. While human coding is often methodical and iterative, AI can make substantial changes quickly. Checkpoints help you track these changes and revert if needed.",
      "Provides safety net for rapid iterations",
      "Makes it easy to undo unexpected results",
      "Try multiple solutions confidently",
      "Compare different implementations",
      "Quickly revert to working states",
      "Ideal for exploring different design patterns or architectural approaches",
      "Use checkpoints as safety nets when experimenting",
      "Leverage auto-approve mode more confidently, knowing you can always roll back",
      "Restore selectively based on needs:",
      "Use \"Restore Task and Workspace\" for a fresh start, reversing changes to files and the task conversation.",
      "Use \"Restore Task Only\" to try different prompts, but leave all files as they exist",
      "Use \"Restore Workspace Only\" to attempt different implementations, or prune context from the task",
      "🛟 Checkpoints are your safety net when working with Cline, enabling you to experiment freely while maintaining full control over your codebase. Whether you're refactoring a complex component, trying different implementation approaches, or using auto-approve mode for rapid development, checkpoints ensure you can always review changes and roll back if needed.",
      "You can delete all checkpoints by using the\"Delete All History\"button in the task history menu. Note that this will also delete all tasks. Checkpoints are stored in VS Code's globalStorage."

You **MUST** follow these guidelines to ensure continuity, context preservation, and efficient task completion.## ⚠️ CONTEXT WINDOW MONITORING - MANDATORY ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️You **MUST** monitor the context window usage displayed in the environment details. When usage exceeds 50% of the available context window, you **MUST** initiate a task handoff using the `new_task` tool.Example of context window usage over 50% with a 200K context window:\\`\\`\\`text# Context Window Usage105,000 / 200,000 tokens (53%)Model: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (200K context window)\\`\\`\\`**IMPORTANT**: When you see context window usage at or above 50%, you MUST:1. Complete your current logical step2. Use the `ask_followup_question` tool to offer creating a new task3. If approved, use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive handoff instructions## Task Breakdown in Plan Mode - REQUIRED PROCESSPlan Mode is specifically designed for analyzing complex tasks and breaking them into manageable subtasks. When in Plan Mode, you **MUST**:### 1. Initial Task Analysis - REQUIRED- **MUST** begin by thoroughly understanding the full scope of the user's request- **MUST** identify all major components and dependencies of the task- **MUST** consider potential challenges, edge cases, and prerequisites### 2. Strategic Task Decomposition - REQUIRED- **MUST** break the overall task into logical, discrete subtasks- **MUST** prioritize subtasks based on dependencies (what must be completed first)- **MUST** aim for subtasks that can be completed within a single session (15-30 minutes of work)- **MUST** consider natural breaking points where context switching makes sense### 3. Creating a Task Roadmap - REQUIRED- **MUST** present a clear, numbered list of subtasks to the user- **MUST** explain dependencies between subtasks- **MUST** provide time estimates for each subtask when possible- **MUST** use Mermaid diagrams to visualize task flow and dependencies when helpful\\`\\`\\`mermaidgraph TDA[Main Task] --> B[Subtask 1: Setup]A --> C[Subtask 2: Core Implementation]A --> D[Subtask 3: Testing]A --> E[Subtask 4: Documentation]B --> CC --> D\\`\\`\\`### 4. Getting User Approval - REQUIRED- **MUST** ask for user feedback on the proposed task breakdown- **MUST** adjust the plan based on user priorities or additional requirements- **MUST** confirm which subtask to begin with- **MUST** request the user to toggle to Act Mode when ready to implement## Task Implementation and Handoff Process - MANDATORY PROCEDURESWhen implementing tasks in Act Mode, you **MUST** follow these guidelines for effective task handoff:### 1. Focused Implementation - REQUIRED- **MUST** focus on completing the current subtask fully- **MUST** document progress clearly through comments and commit messages- **MUST** create checkpoints at logical completion points### 2. Recognizing Completion Points - CRITICALYou **MUST** identify natural handoff points when:- The current subtask is fully completed- You've reached a logical stopping point in a larger subtask- The implementation is taking longer than expected and can be continued later- The task scope has expanded beyond the original plan- **CRITICAL**: The context window usage exceeds 50% (e.g., 100,000+ tokens for a 200K context window)### 3. Initiating the Handoff Process - MANDATORY ACTIONWhen you've reached a completion point, you **MUST**:1. Summarize what has been accomplished so far2. Clearly state what remains to be done3. **MANDATORY**: Use the `ask_followup_question` tool to offer creating a new task:\\`\\`\\`xml<ask_followup_question><question>I've completed [specific accomplishment]. Would you like me to create a new task to continue with [remaining work]?</question><options>[\"Yes, create a new task\", \"No, continue in this session\", \"Let me think about it\"]</options></ask_followup_question>\\`\\`\\`### 4. Creating a New Task with Context - REQUIRED ACTIONIf the user agrees to create a new task, you **MUST** use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive handoff instructions:\\`\\`\\`xml<new_task><context># Task Continuation: [Brief Task Title]## Completed Work- [Detailed list of completed items]- [Include specific files modified/created]- [Note any important decisions made]## Current State- [Description of the current state of the project]- [Any running processes or environment setup]- [Key files and their current state]## Next Steps- [Detailed list of remaining tasks]- [Specific implementation details to address]- [Any known challenges to be aware of]## Reference Information- [Links to relevant documentation]- [Important code snippets or patterns to follow]- [Any user preferences noted during the current session]Please continue the implementation by [specific next action].</context></new_task>\\`\\`\\`### 5. Detailed Context Transfer - MANDATORY COMPONENTSWhen creating a new task, you **MUST** always include:#### Project Context - REQUIRED- **MUST** include the overall goal and purpose of the project- **MUST** include key architectural decisions and patterns- **MUST** include technology stack and dependencies#### Implementation Details - REQUIRED- **MUST** list files created or modified in the current session- **MUST** describe specific functions, classes, or components implemented- **MUST** explain design patterns being followed- **MUST** outline testing approach#### Progress Tracking - REQUIRED- **MUST** provide checklist of completed items- **MUST** provide checklist of remaining items- **MUST** note any blockers or challenges encountered#### User Preferences - REQUIRED- **MUST** note coding style preferences mentioned by the user- **MUST** document specific approaches requested by the user- **MUST** highlight priority areas identified by the user## Best Practices for Effective Handoffs - MANDATORY GUIDELINES### 1. Maintain Continuity - REQUIRED- **MUST** use consistent terminology between tasks- **MUST** reference previous decisions and their rationale- **MUST** maintain the same architectural approach unless explicitly changing direction### 2. Preserve Context - REQUIRED- **MUST** include relevant code snippets in the handoff- **MUST** summarize key discussions from the previous session- **MUST** reference specific files and line numbers when applicable### 3. Set Clear Next Actions - REQUIRED- **MUST** begin the handoff with a clear, actionable next step- **MUST** prioritize remaining tasks- **MUST** highlight any decisions that need to be made### 4. Document Assumptions - REQUIRED- **MUST** clearly state any assumptions made during implementation- **MUST** note areas where user input might be needed- **MUST** identify potential alternative approaches### 5. Optimize for Resumability - REQUIRED- **MUST** structure the handoff so the next session can begin working immediately- **MUST** include setup instructions if environment configuration is needed- **MUST** provide a quick summary at the top for rapid context restoration## Example Task Handoff### Example #1 of an effective task handoff:\\`\\`\\`xml<new_task><context># Task Continuation: Implement User Authentication System## Completed Work- Created basic Express.js server structure- Implemented MongoDB connection and user schema- Completed user registration endpoint with password hashing- Added input validation using Joi- Created initial test suite for registration endpoint## Current State- Server runs successfully on port 3000- MongoDB connection is established- Registration endpoint (/api/users/register) is fully functional- Test suite passes for all registration scenarios## Next Steps1.

When it exceeds 50% (e.g., \"105,000 / 200,000 tokens (53%)\"), you **MUST** proactively initiate the task handoff process using the `ask_followup_question` tool followed by the `new_task` tool. You MUST use the `new_task` tool.By strictly following these guidelines, you'll ensure smooth transitions between tasks, maintain project momentum, and provide the best possible experience for users working on complex, multi-session projects.```markdown## User Interaction & Workflow Considerations*   **Linear Flow:** Currently, using `new_task` creates a linear sequence. The old task ends, and the new one begins. The old task history remains accessible for backtracking.*   **User Approval:** You always have control, approving the handoff and having the chance to modify the context Cline proposes to carry forward.*   **Flexibility:** The core `new_task` tool is a flexible building block. Experiment with `.clinerules` to create workflows that best suit your needs, whether for strict context management, task decomposition, or other creative uses.\n```"

You **MUST** follow these guidelines to ensure continuity, context preservation, and efficient task completion.## ⚠️ CONTEXT WINDOW MONITORING - MANDATORY ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️You **MUST** monitor the context window usage displayed in the environment details. When usage exceeds 50% of the available context window, you **MUST** initiate a task handoff using the `new_task` tool.Example of context window usage over 50% with a 200K context window:\\`\\`\\`text# Context Window Usage105,000 / 200,000 tokens (53%)Model: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (200K context window)\\`\\`\\`**IMPORTANT**: When you see context window usage at or above 50%, you MUST:1. Complete your current logical step2. Use the `ask_followup_question` tool to offer creating a new task3. If approved, use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive handoff instructions## Task Breakdown in Plan Mode - REQUIRED PROCESSPlan Mode is specifically designed for analyzing complex tasks and breaking them into manageable subtasks. When in Plan Mode, you **MUST**:### 1. Initial Task Analysis - REQUIRED- **MUST** begin by thoroughly understanding the full scope of the user's request- **MUST** identify all major components and dependencies of the task- **MUST** consider potential challenges, edge cases, and prerequisites### 2. Strategic Task Decomposition - REQUIRED- **MUST** break the overall task into logical, discrete subtasks- **MUST** prioritize subtasks based on dependencies (what must be completed first)- **MUST** aim for subtasks that can be completed within a single session (15-30 minutes of work)- **MUST** consider natural breaking points where context switching makes sense### 3. Creating a Task Roadmap - REQUIRED- **MUST** present a clear, numbered list of subtasks to the user- **MUST** explain dependencies between subtasks- **MUST** provide time estimates for each subtask when possible- **MUST** use Mermaid diagrams to visualize task flow and dependencies when helpful\\`\\`\\`mermaidgraph TDA[Main Task] --> B[Subtask 1: Setup]A --> C[Subtask 2: Core Implementation]A --> D[Subtask 3: Testing]A --> E[Subtask 4: Documentation]B --> CC --> D\\`\\`\\`### 4. Getting User Approval - REQUIRED- **MUST** ask for user feedback on the proposed task breakdown- **MUST** adjust the plan based on user priorities or additional requirements- **MUST** confirm which subtask to begin with- **MUST** request the user to toggle to Act Mode when ready to implement## Task Implementation and Handoff Process - MANDATORY PROCEDURESWhen implementing tasks in Act Mode, you **MUST** follow these guidelines for effective task handoff:### 1. Focused Implementation - REQUIRED- **MUST** focus on completing the current subtask fully- **MUST** document progress clearly through comments and commit messages- **MUST** create checkpoints at logical completion points### 2. Recognizing Completion Points - CRITICALYou **MUST** identify natural handoff points when:- The current subtask is fully completed- You've reached a logical stopping point in a larger subtask- The implementation is taking longer than expected and can be continued later- The task scope has expanded beyond the original plan- **CRITICAL**: The context window usage exceeds 50% (e.g., 100,000+ tokens for a 200K context window)### 3. Initiating the Handoff Process - MANDATORY ACTIONWhen you've reached a completion point, you **MUST**:1. Summarize what has been accomplished so far2. Clearly state what remains to be done3. **MANDATORY**: Use the `ask_followup_question` tool to offer creating a new task:\\`\\`\\`xml<ask_followup_question><question>I've completed [specific accomplishment]. Would you like me to create a new task to continue with [remaining work]?</question><options>[\"Yes, create a new task\", \"No, continue in this session\", \"Let me think about it\"]</options></ask_followup_question>\\`\\`\\`### 4. Creating a New Task with Context - REQUIRED ACTIONIf the user agrees to create a new task, you **MUST** use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive handoff instructions:\\`\\`\\`xml<new_task><context># Task Continuation: [Brief Task Title]## Completed Work- [Detailed list of completed items]- [Include specific files modified/created]- [Note any important decisions made]## Current State- [Description of the current state of the project]- [Any running processes or environment setup]- [Key files and their current state]## Next Steps- [Detailed list of remaining tasks]- [Specific implementation details to address]- [Any known challenges to be aware of]## Reference Information- [Links to relevant documentation]- [Important code snippets or patterns to follow]- [Any user preferences noted during the current session]Please continue the implementation by [specific next action].</context></new_task>\\`\\`\\`### 5. Detailed Context Transfer - MANDATORY COMPONENTSWhen creating a new task, you **MUST** always include:#### Project Context - REQUIRED- **MUST** include the overall goal and purpose of the project- **MUST** include key architectural decisions and patterns- **MUST** include technology stack and dependencies#### Implementation Details - REQUIRED- **MUST** list files created or modified in the current session- **MUST** describe specific functions, classes, or components implemented- **MUST** explain design patterns being followed- **MUST** outline testing approach#### Progress Tracking - REQUIRED- **MUST** provide checklist of completed items- **MUST** provide checklist of remaining items- **MUST** note any blockers or challenges encountered#### User Preferences - REQUIRED- **MUST** note coding style preferences mentioned by the user- **MUST** document specific approaches requested by the user- **MUST** highlight priority areas identified by the user## Best Practices for Effective Handoffs - MANDATORY GUIDELINES### 1. Maintain Continuity - REQUIRED- **MUST** use consistent terminology between tasks- **MUST** reference previous decisions and their rationale- **MUST** maintain the same architectural approach unless explicitly changing direction### 2. Preserve Context - REQUIRED- **MUST** include relevant code snippets in the handoff- **MUST** summarize key discussions from the previous session- **MUST** reference specific files and line numbers when applicable### 3. Set Clear Next Actions - REQUIRED- **MUST** begin the handoff with a clear, actionable next step- **MUST** prioritize remaining tasks- **MUST** highlight any decisions that need to be made### 4. Document Assumptions - REQUIRED- **MUST** clearly state any assumptions made during implementation- **MUST** note areas where user input might be needed- **MUST** identify potential alternative approaches### 5. Optimize for Resumability - REQUIRED- **MUST** structure the handoff so the next session can begin working immediately- **MUST** include setup instructions if environment configuration is needed- **MUST** provide a quick summary at the top for rapid context restoration## Example Task Handoff### Example #1 of an effective task handoff:\\`\\`\\`xml<new_task><context># Task Continuation: Implement User Authentication System## Completed Work- Created basic Express.js server structure- Implemented MongoDB connection and user schema- Completed user registration endpoint with password hashing- Added input validation using Joi- Created initial test suite for registration endpoint## Current State- Server runs successfully on port 3000- MongoDB connection is established- Registration endpoint (/api/users/register) is fully functional- Test suite passes for all registration scenarios## Next Steps1. Implement login endpoint (/api/users/login)- Use bcrypt to compare passwords- Generate JWT token upon successful login- Add proper error handling for invalid credentials2. Create authentication middleware- Verify JWT tokens- Extract user information- Handle expired tokens3. Add protected routes that require authentication4.

      "Cline addresses enterprise security concerns through its unique client-side architecture that prioritizes data privacy, secure cloud integration, and transparent operations. Below is a comprehensive overview of how Cline maintains robust security measures for enterprise environments."
    ],
    "p": [
      "Last updated17 days ago",
      "Cline operates exclusively as a client-side VSCode extension with zero server-side components. This fundamental design choice ensures that your code and data remain within your secure environment at all times. Unlike traditional AI assistants that send data to external servers for processing, Cline connects directly to your chosen cloud provider's AI endpoints, keeping all sensitive information within your infrastructure boundaries.",
      "Cline implements a strict zero data retention policy, meaning your intellectual property never leaves your secure environment. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit your code to any central servers. This approach significantly reduces potential attack vectors that might otherwise be introduced through data transmission to third-party systems. Telemetry collection is optional and requires explicit consent.",
      "Enterprise teams can access cutting-edge AI models through their existing cloud deployments. Cline supports seamless integration with:",
      "AWS Bedrock",
      "Google Cloud Vertex AI",
      "Microsoft Azure",
      "These integrations utilize your organization's existing security credentials, including native IAM role assumption for AWS. This ensures that all AI processing occurs within your corporate cloud environment, maintaining compliance with your established security protocols.",
      "Cline's codebase is completely open-source, allowing for comprehensive security auditing by your internal teams. This transparency enables security professionals to verify exactly how the extension functions and confirm that it adheres to your organization's security requirements. Organizations can review the code to ensure it aligns with their security policies before deployment.",
      "The extension implements safeguards against unauthorized changes to your codebase. Cline requires explicit user approval for all file modifications and terminal commands, preventing accidental or unwanted alterations. This approval-based workflow maintains the integrity of your projects while still providing AI assistance.",
      "For organizations with strict security review processes, Cline provides comprehensive documentation including detailed deployment diagrams, sequence diagrams illustrating all data flows, and complete security posture documentation. These materials facilitate thorough security reviews and help demonstrate compliance with enterprise data handling standards and regulations.",
      "Enterprise editions of Cline (planned for Q2 2025) will include centralized administration features that allow organizations to:",
      "Manage user access with customizable permission levels",
      "Provision accounts with corporate credentials",
      "Immediately revoke access when needed",
      "Control which AI providers and LLM endpoints can be used",
      "Deploy standardized settings across the organization",
      "Prevent unauthorized use of personal API keys",
      "Cline's architecture supports compliance with data sovereignty requirements and enterprise data handling regulations. The planned Enterprise Complete edition will further enhance governance with detailed audit logging, compliance reporting, and automated policy enforcement mechanisms.",
      "By combining client-side processing, direct cloud provider integration, and transparent operations, Cline offers enterprise teams a secure way to leverage AI assistance while maintaining strict control over their sensitive code and data."

      "Cline supports major cloud providers like AWS Bedrock and Google's Cloud Vertex; whichever your team currently uses is appropriate, and there's no need to change providers to utilize Cline's features.  \n\nFor the purpose of this document, we assume your organization will use cloud-based frontier models. Cloud inference providers offer cutting-edge capabilities and the flexibility to select models which best suit your needs.",
      "Certain scenarios may warrant using local models, including handling highly sensitive data, applications requiring consistent low-latency responses, or compliance with strict data sovereignty requirements. If your team needs to utilize local models,  seewith Cline.",
      "To protect your team's data, Cline supports VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoints, which create private connections between your data and AWS Bedrock. AWS VPCs enhance security by eliminating the need for public IP addresses, network gateways, or complex firewall rules—essentially creating a private highway for data that bypasses the public internet entirely. By keeping traffic within AWS’s private network, teams also benefit from lower latency and more predictable performance when accessing services like AWS Bedrock or custom APIs. For those working with confidential information or operating in highly regulated industries like healthcare or finance, VPCs offers the perfect balance between the accessibility of cloud services and the security of private infrastructure.",

      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expand Cline's capabilities by providing standardized access to external data sources and executable functions. By implementing MCP servers, LLM tools can dynamically retrieve and incorporate relevant information from both local and remote data sources. This capability ensures that the models operate with the most current and contextually appropriate data, improving the accuracy and relevance of their outputs.",
      "MCP servers follow a client-server architecture where hosts (LLM applications like Cline) initiate connections through a transport layer to MCP servers. This architecture inherently provides security benefits as it maintains clear separation between components. Enterprise deployments should focus on the proper implementation of this architecture to ensure secure operations, particularly regarding the message exchange patterns and connection lifecycle management. For MCP architecture details, see, and for latest specifications, see.",
      "For enterprise environments, selecting the appropriate transport mechanism is crucial. While stdio transport works efficiently for local processes, HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport requires additional security measures. TLS should be used for all remote connections whenever possible. This is especially important when MCP servers are deployed across different network segments within corporate infrastructure.",
      "The MCP architecture defines standard error codes and message types (Requests, Results, Errors, and Notifications), providing a structured framework for secure communication. Security teams should consider message validation, sanitizing inputs, checking message size limits, and verifying JSON-RPC format. Additionally, implementing resource protection through access controls, path validation, and request rate limiting helps prevent potential abuse of MCP server capabilities.",
      "For enterprise compliance requirements, implementing comprehensive logging of protocol events, message flows, and errors is essential. The MCP architecture supports diagnostic capabilities including health checks, connection state monitoring, and resource usage tracking. Organizations should extend these capabilities to meet their specific compliance needs, particularly for audit trails of all MCP server interactions and resource access patterns.",
      "By leveraging the client-server design of the MCP architecture and implementing appropriate security controls at each layer, enterprises can safely integrate MCP servers into their environments while maintaining their security posture and meeting regulatory requirements."

      "Creating standardized project instructions ensures that all team members work within consistent guidelines. Start by documenting your project's technical foundation, then identify which information needs to be included in the instructions. The exact scope will vary depending on your team's needs, but generally it's best to provide as much information as possible. By creating comprehensive instructions that all team members follow, you establish a shared understanding of how code should be written, tested, and deployed across your project, resulting in more maintainable and consistent software.",

      "This document explains Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, their capabilities, and how Cline can help build and use them.",
      "Model Context Protocol is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications; it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. MCP servers act as intermediaries between large language models (LLMs), such as Claude, and external tools or data sources. They are small programs that expose functionalities to LLMs, enabling them to interact with the outside world through the MCP. An MCP server is essentially like an API that an LLM can use.",
      "MCP servers define a set of \"tools,\" which are functions the LLM can execute. These tools offer a wide range of capabilities.",
      "Here's how MCP works:",
      "MCP hostsdiscover the capabilities of connected servers and load their tools, prompts, and resources.",
      "Resourcesprovide consistent access to read-only data, akin to file paths or database queries.",
      "Securityis ensured as servers isolate credentials and sensitive data. Interactions require explicit user approval.",
      "The potential of MCP servers is vast. They can be used for a variety of purposes.",
      "Here are some concrete examples of how MCP servers can be used:",
      "Web Services and API Integration:",
      "Monitor GitHub repositories for new issues",
      "Post updates to Twitter based on specific triggers",
      "Retrieve real-time weather data for location-based services",
      "Browser Automation:",
      "Automate web application testing",
      "Scrape e-commerce sites for price comparisons",
      "Generate screenshots for website monitoring",
      "Database Queries:",
      "Generate weekly sales reports",
      "Analyze customer behavior patterns",
      "Create real-time dashboards for business metrics",
      "Project and Task Management:",
      "Automate Jira ticket creation based on code commits",
      "Generate weekly progress reports",
      "Create task dependencies based on project requirements",
      "Codebase Documentation:",
      "Generate API documentation from code comments",
      "Create architecture diagrams from code structure",
      "Maintain up-to-date README files",
      "Cline does not come with any pre-installed MCP servers. You'll need to find and install them separately.",
      "Choose the right approach for your needs:",
      "Ask Cline:You can ask Cline to help you find or  create MCP servers",
      "Customize Existing Servers:Modify existing servers to fit your specific requirements",
      "Cline simplifies the building and use of MCP servers through its AI capabilities.",
      "Natural language understanding:Instruct Cline in natural language to build an MCP server by describing its functionalities. Cline will interpret your instructions and generate the necessary code.",
      "Cloning and building servers:Cline can clone existing MCP server repositories from GitHub and build them automatically.",
      "Configuration and dependency management:Cline handles configuration files, environment variables, and dependencies.",
      "Troubleshooting and debugging:Cline helps identify and resolve errors during development.",
      "Tool execution:Cline seamlessly integrates with MCP servers, allowing you to execute their defined tools.",
      "Context-aware interactions:Cline can intelligently suggest using relevant tools based on conversation context.",
      "Dynamic integrations:Combine multiple MCP server capabilities for complex tasks. For example, Cline could use a GitHub server to get data and a Notion server to create a formatted report.",
      "When working with MCP servers, it's important to follow security best practices:",
      "Authentication:Always use secure authentication methods for API access",
      "Environment Variables:Store sensitive information in environment variables",
      "Access Control:Limit server access to authorized users only",
      "Data Validation:Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks",

      "GitHub:Two of the most common places to find MCP servers on GitHub include:",
      "Online directories:Several websites list MCP servers including:These directories allow users to sort the servers by various criteria such as downloads, date, stars, and use case. Each entry provides information such as features, tools, and configuration instructions.",
      "PulseMCP:This website has a blog post discussing how AI could use MCP servers to make websites obsolete. PulseMCP also includes an FAQ section about MCP servers:",
      "Initiate the Process:Provide Cline with the following information:GitHub Repository URL:The URL of the server's repository.README.md Contents:This is optional but helpful for Cline to understand the server's purpose and configuration. You can copy the README.md file from the GitHub repository.",

      "Example Interaction with Cline:CopyUser: \"Cline, I want to add the MCP server for Brave browser control. Here's the GitHub link: @https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/brave-search Can you add it?\"Cline: \"OK. Cloning the repository to the MCP directory. It needs to be built because it has a 'package.json' file. Should I run 'npm run build'?\"User: \"Yes, build it.\"Cline: \"Build complete. This server needs a browser path. Where's your Brave browser executable?\"User: \"It's in '/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser'.\"Cline: \"OK. I've updated the server config with that path and added it to 'cline_mcp_settings.json'. Anything else?\"User: \"No, that's all. Let's test it.\"Cline: \"Great! Starting the MCP Inspector to test the server connection. After that, we can try controlling the browser from Cline.\"",
      "Cline's Actions:Based on your instructions, Cline will perform the following:Repository Cloning:Cline will clone the repository to your local machine, usually in the directory specified in your configuration.Tweaking:You can guide Cline to modify the server’s configuration. For instance:User:\"This server requires an API key.

      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports two primary transport mechanisms for communication between Cline and MCP servers: Standard Input/Output (STDIO) and Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each has distinct characteristics, advantages, and use cases.",
      "STDIO transport runs locally on your machine and communicates via standard input/output streams.",
      "The client (Cline) spawns an MCP server as a child process",
      "Communication happens through process streams: client writes to server's STDIN, server responds to STDOUT",
      "Each message is delimited by a newline character",
      "Messages are formatted as JSON-RPC 2.0",
      "Locality: Runs on the same machine as Cline",
      "Performance: Very low latency and overhead (no network stack involved)",
      "Simplicity: Direct process communication without network configuration",
      "Relationship: One-to-one relationship between client and server",
      "Security: Inherently more secure as no network exposure",
      "STDIO transport is ideal for:",
      "Local integrations and tools running on the same machine",
      "Security-sensitive operations",
      "Low-latency requirements",
      "Single-client scenarios (one Cline instance per server)",
      "Command-line tools or IDE extensions",
      "Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport runs on a remote server and communicates over HTTP/HTTPS.",
      "The client (Cline) connects to the server's SSE endpoint via HTTP GET request",
      "This establishes a persistent connection where the server can push events to the client",
      "For client-to-server communication, the client makes HTTP POST requests to a separate endpoint",
      "Communication happens over two channels:",
      "Event Stream (GET): Server-to-client updates",
      "Message Endpoint (POST): Client-to-server requests",
      "Remote Access: Can be hosted on a different machine from your Cline instance",
      "Scalability: Can handle multiple client connections concurrently",
      "Protocol: Works over standard HTTP (no special protocols needed)",
      "Persistence: Maintains a persistent connection for server-to-client messages",
      "Authentication: Can use standard HTTP authentication mechanisms",
      "SSE transport is better for:",
      "Remote access across networks",
      "Multi-client scenarios",
      "Public services",
      "Centralized tools that many users need to access",
      "Integration with web services",
      "The choice between STDIO and SSE transports directly impacts how you'll deploy and manage your MCP servers.",
      "STDIO servers run locally on the same machine as Cline, which has several important implications:",
      "Installation: The server executable must be installed on each user's machine",
      "Distribution: You need to provide installation packages for different operating systems",
      "Updates: Each instance must be updated separately",
      "Resources: Uses the local machine's CPU, memory, and disk",
      "Access Control: Relies on the local machine's filesystem permissions",
      "Integration: Easy integration with local system resources (files, processes)",
      "Execution: Starts and stops with Cline (child process lifecycle)",
      "Dependencies: Any dependencies must be installed on the user's machine",
      "A local file search tool using STDIO would:",
      "Run on the user's machine",
      "Have direct access to the local filesystem",
      "Start when needed by Cline",
      "Not require network configuration",
      "Need to be installed alongside Cline or via a package manager",
      "SSE servers can be deployed to remote servers and accessed over the network:",
      "Installation: Installed once on a server, accessed by many users",
      "Distribution: Single deployment serves multiple clients",
      "Updates: Centralized updates affect all users immediately",
      "Resources: Uses server resources, not local machine resources",
      "Access Control: Managed through authentication and authorization systems",
      "Integration: More complex integration with user-specific resources",
      "Execution: Runs as an independent service (often continuously)",
      "Dependencies: Managed on the server, not on user machines",
      "A database query tool using SSE would:",
      "Run on a central server",
      "Connect to databases with server-side credentials",
      "Be continuously available for multiple users",
      "Require proper network security configuration",
      "Be deployed using container or cloud technologies",
      "Some scenarios benefit from a hybrid approach:",
      "STDIO with Network Access: A local STDIO server that acts as a proxy to remote services",
      "SSE with Local Commands: A remote SSE server that can trigger operations on the client machine through callbacks",
      "Gateway Pattern: STDIO servers for local operations that connect to SSE servers for specialized functions",

      "Local machine only",
      "Local or remote",

      "Last updated14 days ago",
      "🚀Build and share your MCP servers with the world.Once you've created a great MCP server, submit it to theto make it discoverable and one-click installable by thousands of developers.",
      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend AI assistants like Cline by giving them the ability to:",
      "Access external APIs and services",
      "Retrieve real-time data",
      "Control applications and local systems",
      "Perform actions beyond what text prompts alone can achieve",
      "Without MCP, AI assistants are powerful but isolated. With MCP, they gain the ability to interact with virtually any digital system.",
      "The heart of effective MCP server development is following a structured protocol. This protocol is implemented through a.clinerulesfile that lives at therootof your MCP working directory (/Users/your-name/Documents/Cline/MCP).",
      "A.clinerulesfile is a special configuration that Cline reads automatically when working in the directory where it's placed. These files:",
      "Configure Cline's behavior and enforce best practices",
      "Switch Cline into a specialized MCP development mode",
      "Provide a step-by-step protocol for building servers",
      "Implement safety measures like preventing premature completion",
      "Guide you through planning, implementation, and testing phases",
      "Here's the complete MCP Server Development Protocol that should be placed in your.clinerulesfile:",
      "When this.clinerulesfile is present in your working directory, Cline will:",
      "Start inPLAN MODEto design your server before implementation",
      "Enforce proper implementation patterns inACT MODE",
      "Require testing of all tools before allowing completion",
      "Guide you through the entire development lifecycle",
      "Creating an MCP server requires just a few simple steps to get started:",
      "First, add a.clinerulesfile to the root of your MCP working directory using the protocol above. This file configures Cline to use the MCP development protocol when working in this folder.",
      "Begin your Cline chat by clearly describing what you want to build. Be specific about:",
      "The purpose of your MCP server",
      "Which API or service you want to integrate with",
      "Any specific tools or features you need",
      "For example:",
      "Cline will automatically start in PLAN MODE, guiding you through the planning process:",
      "Discussing the problem scope",
      "Reviewing API documentation",
      "Planning authentication methods",
      "Designing tool interfaces",
      "When ready, switch to ACT MODE using the toggle at the bottom of the chat to begin implementation.",
      "One of the most effective ways to help Cline build your MCP server is to share official API documentation right at the start:",
      "Providing comprehensive API details (endpoints, authentication, data structures) significantly improves Cline's ability to implement an effective MCP server.",
      "In this collaborative phase, you work with Cline to design your MCP server:",
      "Define the problem scope",
      "Choose appropriate APIs",
      "Plan authentication methods",
      "Design the tool interfaces",
      "Determine data formats",
      "Once planning is complete, Cline helps implement the server:",
      "Set up the project structure",
      "Write the implementation code",
      "Configure settings",
      "Test each component thoroughly",
      "Finalize documentation",
      "Let's walk through the development process of our AlphaAdvantage MCP server, which provides stock data analysis and reporting capabilities.",
      "During the planning phase, we:",
      "Defined the problem: Users need access to financial data, stock analysis, and market insights directly through their AI assistant",
      "Selected the API: AlphaAdvantage API for financial market data",
      "Standard API key authentication",
      "Rate limits of 5 requests per minute (free tier)",
      "Various endpoints for different financial data types",
      "Designed the tools needed:",
      "Stock overview information (current price, company details)",
      "Technical analysis with indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)",
      "Fundamental analysis (financial statements, ratios)",
      "Earnings report data",
      "News and sentiment analysis",
      "Planned data formatting:",
      "Clean, well-formatted markdown output",
      "Tables for structured data",
      "Visual indicators (↑/↓) for trends",
      "Proper formatting of financial numbers",
      "We began by bootstrapping the project:",
      "Next, we structured our project with:",
      "API Client Implementation",
      "The API client implementation included:",
      "Rate limiting: Enforcing the 5 requests per minute limit",
      "Caching: Reducing API calls with strategic caching",
      "Error handling: Robust error detection and reporting",
      "Typed interfaces: Clear TypeScript types for all data",
      "Key implementation details:",
      "Markdown Formatting",
      "We implemented formatters to display financial data beautifully:",
      "Tool Implementation",
      "We defined five tools with clear interfaces:",
      "Each tool's handler included:",
      "Input validation",
      "API client calls with error handling",
      "Markdown formatting of responses",
      "Comprehensive logging",
      "This critical phase involved systematically testing each tool:",
      "First, we configured the MCP server in the settings:",
      "Then we tested each tool individually:",
      "get_stock_overview: Retrieved AAPL stock overview information",
      "get_technical_analysis: Obtained price action and RSI data",
      "get_earnings_report: Retrieved MSFT earnings history and formatted report",
      "During development, we encountered several challenges:",
      "API Rate Limiting:",
      "Challenge: Free tier limited to 5 calls per minute",
      "Solution: Implemented queuing, enforced rate limits, and added comprehensive caching",
      "Data Formatting:",
      "Challenge: Raw API data not user-friendly",
      "Solution: Created formatting utilities for consistent display of financial data",
      "Timeout Issues:",
      "Challenge: Complex tools making multiple API calls could timeout",
      "Solution: Suggested breaking complex tools into smaller pieces, optimizing caching",
      "Our AlphaAdvantage implementation taught us several key lessons:",
      "Plan for API Limits: Understand and design around API rate limits from the beginning",
      "Cache Strategically: Identify high-value caching opportunities to improve performance",
      "Format for Readability: Invest in good data formatting for improved user experience",
      "Test Every Path: Test all tools individually before completion",
      "Handle API Complexity: For APIs requiring multiple calls, design tools with simpler scopes",
      "Effective logging is essential for debugging MCP servers:",
      "Type definitions prevent errors and improve maintainability:",
      "Reduce API calls and improve performance:",
      "Implement robust error handling that maintains a good user experience:",
      "Resources let your MCP servers expose data to Cline without executing code. They're perfect for providing context like files, API responses, or database records that Cline can reference during conversations.",
      "Define the resourcesyour server will expose:",
      "Implement read handlersto deliver the content:",
      "Challenge: APIs often have different authentication methods.",
      "Solution:",
      "For API keys, use environment variables in the MCP configuration",
      "For OAuth, create a separate script to obtain refresh tokens",
      "Store sensitive tokens securely",
      "Challenge: APIs may not provide all the functionality you need.",
      "Solution:",
      "Implement fallbacks using available endpoints",
      "Create simulated functionality where necessary",
      "Transform API data to match your needs",
      "Challenge: Most APIs have rate limits that can cause failures.",
      "Solution:",
      "Implement proper rate limiting",
      "Add intelligent caching",
      "Provide graceful degradation",
      "Add transparent errors about rate limits",
