# What is Apigee API hub?Stay organized with collectionsSave and categorize content based on your preferences.

This page
applies toApigeeandApigee hybrid.

Apigee API hub lets you consolidate and organize information about all of the APIs of interest to
  your organization. API hub lets you capture critical information about APIs that allows developers to discover
  and evaluate them easily and leverage the work of other teams wherever possible. API platform teams can use
  API hub to gain visibility into and manage their portfolio of APIs.

Many organizations are challenged by the increasing number of APIs that they
    develop and use. As the number of APIs increases, they become harder to track,
    which can lead to duplication rather than reuse, an expensive inefficiency.
    When APIs proliferate without design standards and governance checks, the
    API landscape grows inconsistent, slowing teams down, while a well-organized
    API program helps them go faster.

The API hub experience is primarily aimed at consumers and producers of APIs
    within an organization whose main concerns are finding, listing, comparing, and evaluating APIs
    both within and external to the organization's network ecosystem.
    API hub allows you to manage a complete catalog of all your APIs along with their associated
    entities, including API versions, dependencies, deployments, and more. You can also associate
    API specifications with API versions, and for OpenAPI specs, API hub parses them and extracts
    metadata, including API operations. In addition, you can link an API version to a particular
    API deployment endpoint.

API hub administrators can:

With API hub, you bring rich information about your APIs together into
    one place to accelerate the consistency, use, reuse, and governance of your API
    portfolio.

AnAPI resourcerepresents an API that exists within your
    organization's network ecosystem. API
    resources stored in API hub are searchable and provide detailed operational and descriptive
    information about the API such as deployments, versions, operations, lifecycle stage, and other key attributes.

The ability to model and organizeAPI versionsis a key feature of API hub.
      Every API resource in API hub has at least one version associated with it. You can
      think of a version as the state of an API at a point in time. Fundamentally, versions
      help you group and organize your APIs based on underlying sets of operations, deployments,
      and other metadata.

Auto-registration refers to getting API data from external systems into API hub.
    You can register all the proxies present in an Apigee or Apigee hybrid runtime project directly in API hub
    by attaching your runtime project to API hub. SeeAuto-register Apigee proxies.

Another key API hub feature is its ability toparse certain API specifications,
        such as OpenAPI specs, into their contained definitions, operations, and other key components,
        and store that information with an API resource. API hub also provides linting feedback
        for imported specifications.

API hub's powerfulsearch capabilitiessupport both LLM-based
      free-text and filter-based search operations that let you search based on any part
      of the API definition. These powerful search tools enable you to identify the API asset
      that serves specific use cases so that you can either avoid rebuilding or duplicating API
      engineering efforts.

API hubAPI supply chainhelps you view and manage the operational
    relationships ordependenciesbetween your APIs. Finding and tracking an API's dependencies
    helps you manage your API ecosystem more efficiently and troubleshoot broken API operations.
